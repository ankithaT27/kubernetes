with ingress, we can specify reqyests coming to which path should go to which service,
eg:
requests coming to abc.com/users should go to service A and xyz.com should go to service B, these are called ingress rules
Ingress controller should be there to process ingress rules
so any reqyest coming will first go to LB, from then it goes to infress controller which then pocess rules and then hits the correct service


How does it work?
the request coming from user, first hits LB, then ingress controller checks for rules, then the correct service and then pod
Ingress controller: 
HAProxy
Traffeik
Nginx controller

sample:

apiVersion:
Kind:
meadata:
spec:
 rules:
   - host: todo.com
     http:
       paths:
        -path: /
         pathType: prefix
        backend:
           service: nginx-service
          port:
             number:8082

Notes: using minikube, its not possible to create a domian name called todo.com, so we get the minikube ip address and we map the todo.com with ip

so update /etc/hosts file by adding this ip
Format:
ip todo.com



path based routing, has 2 seperate paths and only 1 host , i.e w different websites (eg: todo-api.com, todo-ui.com)
are accessed using same host todo.com
in the path we mention requests coming to (/) will go to todo-api and reqyests coming to  path /ui will go to todo-ui.com

host-based routing, it has 2 different hosts and 2 applications are defined using 2 different hosts here.
eg: host1 (todo-api.com) and host2 will be (todo-ui.com) but path will remain the same may be path :/


Note: we can also add a TLS certificate in ingress by first saving it as a secret
usage in nginx ingress.yml file
spec:
 tls:
  sectret: certfilename
  host:nginxdemo
