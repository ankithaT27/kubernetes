with ingress, we can specify reqyests coming to which path should go to which service,
eg:
requests coming to abc.com/users should go to service A and abc.com/projects should go to service B, these are called ingress rules
Ingress controller should be there to process ingress rules

How does it work?
the request coming from user, first hits LB, then ingress controller checks for rules, then the correct service and then pod
