CM- gets heartbeats from pods, node monitor period is 5 sec(node monitor period)
grace period is 40s meaning it will wait 40seconds until it marks node as unhealthy and waits 5 second again before removing it
scheduler schedules using 2 thibngs:
it filters nodes
it ranks nodes

kubectk run nginx --image ngunx
kubectl replace -f replica.yaml
kubectk scale --replicas=6 replica.yaml or nameof RS
kubectl get pods --namespace=kubesystem
kubecrl create namespace dev
resoyrce quota yaml file limits resource utilisation like cpu etc to its own NS

What DNS name should the Blue application use to access the database db-service in the dev namespace?
db-service.dev.svc.cluster.local
kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service
kubectl create deployment  webapp --image=kodekloud/webapp-color --replicas=3 -n=mynamespace

kubectl run httpd --image=httpd:alpine --port=80 --expose
edit files:
kubectl replace commands
kubectl get pods --selector apps=myapp

what happens if scheduler isnt there?
All pods continue to be in pending state thus we can use
 nodename:node02 component in the file while creating yaml file
if the pod is already created and you want to assign it to a pod it can be done with the help of a curl command using post request

Taints and tolerations:
stop a node from getting pod assigned to it
only the pod that has tolerations assigned to it will be scheduled on that node
so be default a taint will be applied on master so we dont see the scheduling here


kubectl taint nodes node01 spray=mortein:NoSchedule

node selectors: select the nodes to place the pods on 
we do it by specifiying lables:
kubectl label nodes node-1 size=large (this way we mark the largest node ) and we define the node selectors as size:Large in deployement file



kubectl apply:
creates live object config file once the apply command in run and also a json file is created called last object config
