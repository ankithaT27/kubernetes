eg: for any appln aunuthentication, we set the flag as authenticated=true in the db when the person has already logged in to the application before so rather than in the app. these type of app are called stateful sets

problem:
i) all deployments use a common Persistant storage. this is not a good approach for matser-slave
ii) whenever we create an db application: master should come up 1st, replica 1 copies data from master, 2 copies data from 1.
all the time data should be copied from its previous replica whenevr the pod comes up, but if we use deployment all 3 replicas are created at the sametime
same- last pod deleted first 
iii) even when pod restarts, there should be sticky identity and it should get teh same name again which is not possible in deploynent
iv) the same sticky volume is also attached to each pod, eg: all write requests should go to master
