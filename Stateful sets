Stateless appln - Deployment
Staeful appln- DB , Sttefule sets (we can rep;icate this as well)
Note:
Replica pods created are not identical, they have their own identity
* Master DB and Slave DB concept
Conside we have 3 replicas, a newly created replia will clone all the data from previous replica
Deployment assigns a random hash name for all pods but nit S.A , it assigns fixed ordered names
The new replica DB will be created only after the previous one is fully up and running and deletion always starts from last pod
when a pod restarts, the IP address change, but name and enpoints remain same
