Img restart ploicy:
The Always restart policy is the default policy in Kubernetes.
By using this policy, containers will restart when they terminate, regardless of their exit status. In other words, this policy doesnâ€™t care why the container exited, whether it is a successful completion or an error. It will always make sure that the container is running.

The OnFailure restart policy will restart a container only if the container process exits with an error
