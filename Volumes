One of the key benefits of using Persistent Volumes is their ability to decouple storage from individual pods. This decoupling allows for greater flexibility in managing pods, as the data stored in a Persistent Volume remains intact even if a pod is deleted or rescheduled. Additionally, Persistent Volumes support various access modes, allowing multiple pods to read and write data simultaneously.

Access Modes
ReadOnlyMany(ROX) allows being mounted by multiple nodes in read-only mode.
ReadWriteOnce(RWO) allows being mounted by a single node in read-write mode.
ReadWriteMany(RWX) allows multiple nodes to be mounted in read-write mode.
