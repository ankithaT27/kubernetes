# kubernetes

Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

Command used for yaml files:
kubectl apply -f filename.yaml

A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the container

A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.
